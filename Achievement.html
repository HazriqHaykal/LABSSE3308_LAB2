      <p>My journey through high school was anything but easy, especially with the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic during my Form 4 and Form 5 years. Despite the uncertainties and disruptions, I remained determined and worked hard to achieve my goals. In my SPM, I proudly secured 9As and 1B+, and I was honored with the Best Subject Award for Biology, History, and Tasawwur Islam.</p>

      <p>It was an honor to receive an award from the former <strong>Ketua Polis Negara</strong> for achieving excellent results in my SPM. Shaking hands with him was a truly memorable moment. His name is <strong>Tan Sri Dato' Seri Panglima Acryl Sani bin Haji Abdullah Sani</strong>, and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to meet him in person.</p>

      <p>My first and second semesters in my Software Engineering degree were tough, but I managed to make it to the <strong>Dean's List</strong> for both semesters. It was an incredible moment to be recognized at the <strong>Majlis Anugerah Prestij Fakulti</strong>. What made it even more special was celebrating this achievement with my friends and coursemates.</p>
