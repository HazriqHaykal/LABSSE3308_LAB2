            <p>Once I’ve gained valuable experience at PNB, my long-term goal is to launch my own tech startup. I hope to apply the professional skills, industry knowledge, and strategic thinking I’ve developed to build innovative digital solutions that address real-world problems. My vision is to create technology that not only drives business growth but also supports Malaysia’s progress in becoming a competitive player in the global digital economy. I’m especially passionate about leveraging technology to improve lives, increase efficiency, and promote sustainable development across sector</p>
